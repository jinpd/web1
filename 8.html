<p style="margin-top:45px;"><strong>Yesterday</strong>
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, <u>I believe in</u> <strong>Yesterday</strong>
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hangin' over me
Oh, <strong>Yesterday</strong> came suddenly
Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for <strong>Yesterday</strong>
<strong>Yesterday</strong>
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in <strong>Yesterday</strong>
Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for <strong>Yesterday</strong>
<strong>Yesterday</strong>
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in <strong>Yesterday</strong>
Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm</p>
